# Bubble Interaction App 🎈

This is a dynamic interactive canvas-based app where users can click on colored bubbles to trigger animations, sound effects, and color changes. It showcases fundamental concepts of canvas rendering, animation, physics, and interactivity in JavaScript.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎯 Clickable bubbles that trigger animations and sounds
- ➡️ Animated arrows that move toward the bubble
- 🌈 Random color changes on hit
- ✨ Particle explosion effects on bubble hit
- 🔁 Reset functionality to restore initial state
- ⚙️ Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Web Audio API for sound effects
- Object-Oriented JavaScript for modular design

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file with canvas and controls
- `app.js` – Initializes canvas, handles events, and logic
- `ParticleSystem.js` – Manages particle effects
- `Physics.js` – Handles bubble movement and collisions
- `Renderer.js` – Handles all drawing/rendering logic
- `Utils.js` – Utility functions (colors, math, etc.)
- `SoundGenerator.js` – Plays click and pop sounds

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Click on bubbles to see effects, or hit **Reset** to restart.

## 🧠 Learning Highlights

- Real-time canvas rendering and animations
- Handling interactivity with mouse events
- Modular, class-based JavaScript architecture
- Physics simulation and collision handling
- Efficient rendering using `requestAnimationFrame`
